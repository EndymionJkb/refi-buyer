# Issuance of land ownership credentials

This is the UI for the "Agriculture Secretary" to create Polygon ID VC's attesting to the property ownership of individuals.

(At first, we thought there would only be one UI; hence the name - that's a hackathon for you.)

There is also a "Minter" UI, which verifies the Polygon ID credential and causes the minting of `Steward Tokens`, proportional to land ownership.

Finally, there is the "Offset" UI, which allows users to purchase and retire carbon credits on Celo (50/50 NCT and Steward Tokens), and receive an NFT.
